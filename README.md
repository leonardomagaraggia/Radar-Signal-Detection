# Radar Signal Detection & Classification

This project simulates a simplified radar sensing system to detect and classify targets
in noisy signals.

## Project structure
- data_generation: signal simulation
- signal_processing: FFT and filtering
- features: feature extraction
- models: ML classifiers
- evaluation: robustness analysis

## Goal
Study how signal processing and machine learning behave under noise and low SNR conditions.
